Tokenized Real Estate Platform – Full Business and Technical Workflow
🧭 Full Workflow for the Tokenized Real Estate Investment Platform (Estathub)

This document describes the complete investment journey for a Saudi real estate asset on the Estathub platform – 
from onboarding the property to allowing fractional investment via tokenization using a private blockchain network.

🎯 Beneficiary Roles

• Property Owner: Person who owns the real estate and wants to tokenize it.
• Investor: Individual user who wants to buy shares in the property.
• Estathub Platform: The marketplace and technical engine.
• Blockchain Layer: Based on Hyperledger Fabric.
• Wallet Layer: Handles investor token holding and earnings.

🔁 Detailed Workflow Steps
1. Property Registration & Tokenization (by Property Owner)

- Owner submits a request to list a property.
- Uploads include: Ownership certificate and income proof (e.g., lease contract).
- Platform verifies documents (manual or via Real Estate Authority).
- System calculates:
  * Market Value
  * Token Count = Property Value ÷ Token Price (e.g., 10,000,000 ÷ 1,000 = 10,000 tokens)
- A Smart Contract is generated with:
  * Property details, each token’s share, and profit distribution rules.
- The smart contract is deployed to the private Hyperledger Fabric network.

2. Property Listing on UI (Automatic)

- Property appears on the "Investment Opportunities" page.
- Each property has a card view with:
  * Project Name, Total Value, Token Price, Monthly Return, Token Count Remaining, Blockchain Info.
- Each card links to smart contract and wallet layer.

3. Token Purchase Process (by Investor)

- Investor registers on the platform.
- Selects property and number of tokens.
- Payment made through Apple Pay / Visa / Mada using a payment gateway like PayTabs.
- After payment:
  * A wallet is created (temporary or permanent).
  * Tokens are issued via blockchain to investor's wallet.
  * Dashboard shows “You own X tokens”.
  * A Token Certificate is issued.

4. Monthly Return Distribution (by Platform + Owner)

- Owner transfers rental income monthly.
- Platform distributes earnings based on token share.
- Returns are added to each investor’s wallet.
- Investors can:
  * Withdraw to a local bank.
  * Re-invest in other properties.

5. Exit Scenario (Future)

- Investors can sell tokens:
  * In a secondary market within the platform.
  * Back to the property owner (Buyback Option).
